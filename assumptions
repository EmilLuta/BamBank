Each user name is unique.
The timezone of the bank users is utc.
The projects size will stay the same and no grouping is needed on the templates.
There will always be only one currency and a single flow of the money (one account = one bank account), therefore it is not needed to have a separate model to handle balance.
Transactions can't be float amountwise.
The users are happy with slower validation hence they are not paying for the product, therefore there is no need to keep the password hash as binary in the database.
We have a small userbase, therefore a search for the transactions is not mandatory, yet!
